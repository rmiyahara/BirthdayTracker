Hello user! Thanks for using my Birthday Tracker. I initially made this to keep
track of everyone on UCLA's Kyodo Taiko's birthdays. As the head of moralers
for the 2017 - 2018 school year, I needed something to remind me when to make
birthday posts for everyone in the club. I also used this as an excuse to
practice my Python.

| SET UP |
----------
First, set up names.txt. The current file in this directory can be used as a
reference. Each name should have its own line.

Next, set up birthdays.txt. Again, follow the format of the included file. Each
name should correspond with its name counterpart. For example, the first person
on names.txt should have the first birthday in birthdays.txt. Each date gets its
own line in the format M/DD/YYYY.


Lastly, in the start menu, run the Run application. Inside the following
textbox, paste the following line:
shell:startup
This will open a folder of applications that run during your computers boot
process. In this folder, drop a shortcut of the checkbirthdays.bat file. This
shortcut can be created by right clicking checkbirthdays.bat, then clicking
"Create Shortcut". After the shortcut has been created and moved to the Startup
folder, you are all done! Every time you start your PC, a window terminal will
remind you whose birthday it is or whose is closest to the current date.
